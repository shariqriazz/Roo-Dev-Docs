# Chapter 58: Documentation & Community Files

Continuing from [Chapter 57: Testing Framework](57_testing_framework.md), which detailed how Roo-Code ensures code quality through automated testing, this concluding chapter examines the essential supporting files that explain the project, guide contributors, establish standards, and foster a healthy community: **Documentation & Community Files**.

## Motivation: Guiding Users, Contributors, and Maintaining Standards

A software project, especially an open-source one like Roo-Code, requires more than just functional code to thrive. Without clear documentation and standard community guidelines, users struggle to understand features, potential contributors face high barriers to entry, and the project can become difficult to maintain or evolve consistently.

Documentation and community files serve critical purposes:

1.  **User Guidance:** Providing clear instructions on installation, configuration ([Chapter 35: Settings UI Components (WebView)](35_settings_ui_components__webview_.md)), and using Roo-Code's diverse features ([Chapter 1: WebView UI](01_webview_ui.md), [Chapter 8: Tools](08_tools.md)).
2.  **Developer Onboarding:** Offering a roadmap for contributors, including setup ([Chapter 56: Build System](56_build_system.md)), testing procedures ([Chapter 57: Testing Framework](57_testing_framework.md)), architectural understanding (this tutorial series!), and contribution workflows.
3.  **Architecture & Design:** Explaining the "why" behind design choices and the structure of core components ([Chapter 2: ClineProvider](02_clineprovider.md), [Chapter 4: Cline](04_cline.md), [Chapter 5: ApiHandler](05_apihandler.md), etc.).
4.  **Community Standards:** Setting clear expectations for behaviour (`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`), contribution quality (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.roo/rules/rules.md`), localization practices (`.roo/rules-translate/`), and security reporting (`SECURITY.md`).
5.  **Collaboration:** Streamlining communication through issue/PR templates and providing clear channels for help or discussion.
6.  **Transparency & Compliance:** Defining the project's license (`LICENSE`), tracking changes (`CHANGELOG.md`), and outlining data handling practices (`PRIVACY.md`).

These files collectively make the project accessible, maintainable, welcoming, and professional.

**Central Use Case:**
*   **New User:** Wants to know how to install Roo-Code, connect their OpenAI key, and understand what the different "Modes" do. They start with `README.md`, follow links to configuration details possibly in `docs/`, and check `CHANGELOG.md` for recent features.
*   **New Contributor:** Wants to fix a bug they found. They consult `CONTRIBUTING.md` for setup instructions and the PR process. They look at `docs/architecture/` to understand the relevant code modules. They check `.roo/rules/rules.md` for coding standards and testing requirements before submitting a PR using the `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`.
*   **Translator:** Needs to add German translations. They read the general workflow in `.roo/rules-translate/001-general-rules.md` and the specific requirements (like using "du") in `instructions-de.md`. They use the `find-missing-translations.js` script to ensure completeness.

## Key Concepts & Files

Roo-Code utilizes a standard set of documentation and community health files, primarily in Markdown format, located in the project root, `.github/`, `docs/`, and the project-specific `.roo/` directory.

1.  **`README.md`:** (Root) The main entry point. Includes:
    *   Project description and value proposition.
    *   Badges (build status, version, license).
    *   Screenshots/GIFs.
    *   Key feature list.
    *   Installation and quick start instructions.
    *   Links to detailed documentation (`docs/`), community channels (Discord, Reddit), and contribution guidelines.
    *   Auto-generated contributor list (updated by `scripts/update-contributors.js`).
    *   License information.
    *   Localized versions (e.g., `locales/ja/README.md`) provide this information in different languages.

2.  **`LICENSE`:** (Root) The full text of the project's open-source license (e.g., Apache 2.0 or MIT). Defines legal permissions and limitations.

3.  **`CHANGELOG.md`:** (Root) A chronological log of notable changes for each released version, following the "Keep a Changelog" format (Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed). Essential for users tracking updates.

4.  **`CONTRIBUTING.md`:** (Root) Comprehensive guide for potential contributors. Covers:
    *   Getting started (forking, cloning).
    *   Development environment setup (`pnpm install:all`).
    *   Building the code (`pnpm build:prod` - linking to [Chapter 56](56_build_system.md)).
    *   Running tests (`pnpm test` - linking to [Chapter 57](57_testing_framework.md)).
    *   Coding standards (referencing `.roo/rules/rules.md`).
    *   Commit message guidelines.
    *   Pull request process (branching, rebasing, using the template).
    *   Where to find issues or discuss features.

5.  **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`:** (Root) Defines expected behavior within the community to ensure a positive and inclusive environment. Often based on the Contributor Covenant.

6.  **`SECURITY.md`:** (Root) Specifies the private and responsible procedure for reporting potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., dedicated email, GitHub Security Advisories).

7.  **`PRIVACY.md`:** (Root) Details the project's data handling practices, focusing on user privacy. Explains what telemetry data ([Chapter 52: TelemetryService](52_telemetryservice.md)) might be collected (only if user opts-in), why it's collected, how it's anonymized, that no code/prompts/keys are collected, and how users can control consent. Crucial for transparency and trust.

8.  **`.github/` Directory:** Contains files automating GitHub interactions:
    *   `ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (e.g., `bug_report.md`, `feature_request.md`): Standardizes issue reporting by prompting users for specific information (steps to reproduce, versions, expected behavior).
    *   `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`: Provides a checklist and structure for PR descriptions (link to issue, summary of changes, testing performed).
    *   `workflows/` (e.g., `ci.yaml`): Defines GitHub Actions workflows to automatically run linting, type checking, tests, and builds on pushes and pull requests, ensuring code quality and preventing regressions.

9.  **`docs/` Directory:** Houses more extensive documentation:
    *   User guides, configuration deep-dives, feature explanations.
    *   `architecture/`: Contains this tutorial series (`01_webview_ui.md`, `02_clineprovider.md`, ..., `58_documentation_community_files.md`), providing in-depth explanations of the codebase structure and components. May also include diagrams.

10. **`.roo/` Directory:** Contains project-specific rule sets:
    *   `rules/rules.md`: Detailed coding standards, architectural principles (e.g., state management patterns), testing requirements (e.g., coverage goals), UI/UX guidelines (e.g., use of themed components). Serves as a reference for developers and potentially context for AI development assistants. ([Chapter 48: Configuration Rules](48_configuration_rules.md)).
    *   `rules-translate/`: Specific guidelines for localization ([Chapter 50: Localization System (i18n)](50_localization_system__i18n_.md)). Includes `001-general-rules.md` (tone, non-translatables, placeholders, QA process) and language-specific files like `instructions-de.md` (e.g., "du" form mandate) or `instructions-zh-cn.md` (glossary, formatting). Used by human translators and potentially AI translation tools.

## Using These Files

*   **Users:** Start with `README.md` for installation and basic usage. Explore `docs/` for deeper dives. Check `CHANGELOG.md` for updates. Use `ISSUE_TEMPLATE`s for reporting bugs or suggesting features. Refer to `PRIVACY.md` for data collection details.
*   **Contributors:** Read `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` thoroughly. Understand the architecture via `docs/architecture/`. Follow coding standards in `.roo/rules/rules.md` and community expectations in `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`. Use GitHub templates (`ISSUE_TEMPLATE`, `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`) and ensure CI checks (`workflows/`) pass.
*   **Translators:** Focus on `.roo/rules-translate/` files for specific instructions, terminology, and QA procedures (like using `scripts/find-missing-translations.js`).
*   **Maintainers:** Use all documents to guide the project, review contributions against standards (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `rules.md`), manage issues and PRs using templates, ensure CI workflows are effective, and uphold the `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
*   **AI Assistants (Internal Dev):** Can be fed relevant `.roo/rules/` files as context to ensure AI-generated code or documentation suggestions adhere to project standards.
*   **VS Code Marketplace:** Automatically displays content from `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and `LICENSE`. Uses information from `package.json`. `PRIVACY.md` might be linked or required.

## Code Walkthrough

These files are primarily human-readable text or configuration formats.

### `.roo/rules/rules.md` (Structure Summary)

*(Refer to Chapter 48 for detailed example)*
*   Sections: General Principles, Testing (linking to [Chapter 57](57_testing_framework.md)), TypeScript Usage, UI Components ([Chapter 32](32_vscode_webview_ui_toolkit_wrappers.md), [Chapter 33](33_shadcn_ui_primitives__webview_.md)), State Management ([Chapter 11](11_contextproxy.md), [Chapter 12](12_extensionstatecontext.md)), Error Handling, Dependencies.
*   Content: Specific guidelines, best practices, requirements (e.g., test coverage minimums).

### `.roo/rules-translate/` Files (Structure Summary)

*(Refer to Chapter 50 for detailed example)*
*   `001-general-rules.md`: Workflow, QA script usage, tone, non-translatables, placeholder syntax (`{{var}}`, `<1>`).
*   `instructions-<lang>.md`: Language-specific directives (e.g., German "du"), glossaries, formatting notes.

### GitHub Workflow Example (`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`)

*(Refer to Chapter 57 for detailed example)*
*   YAML file defining triggers (`on: push/pull_request`).
*   Jobs (e.g., `build_and_test`) running on specific OS (`runs-on`).
*   Steps: Checkout code, setup Node/pnpm, install dependencies (`pnpm install:all`), run checks (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm compile`, `pnpm test`), run build (`pnpm build:prod`). Uses GitHub Actions syntax (`uses:`, `with:`, `run:`).

### Contributor Update Script (`scripts/update-contributors.js`)

*(Refer to Chapter 55 for detailed example)*
*   Node.js script using `https` module for GitHub API calls.
*   Fetches paginated contributor data.
*   Filters bots.
*   Generates Markdown table (`formatContributorsSection`).
*   Uses `fs` module to read/write README files, replacing content between sentinel comments (`<!-- START/END CONTRIBUTORS SECTION -->`).

## Internal Implementation

These files are mostly static content interpreted by humans or specific platforms/tools:

*   **Markdown (`.md`):** Rendered by GitHub, VS Code Marketplace, documentation site generators, or previewers. Structure and formatting matter for readability.
*   **YAML (`.yaml`):** Parsed by GitHub Actions runner or script libraries like `js-yaml`. Syntax must be correct.
*   **JSON (`.json`):** Parsed by VS Code (NLS files) or Node.js scripts (`JSON.parse`). Syntax must be correct.
*   **Plain Text (`LICENSE`):** Legal text.
*   **Scripts (`.js`):** Executed by Node.js to perform specific tasks (e.g., `update-contributors.js`, `find-missing-translations.js`).

## Modification Guidance

Modifications involve updating content to ensure accuracy, clarity, and relevance as the project evolves.

1.  **Updating `README.md` / `docs/`:** After adding a major feature, update the README's feature list, add usage examples, and create/update relevant pages in `docs/`. Ensure screenshots are current. Fix any broken links.
2.  **Updating `CHANGELOG.md`:** Before tagging a new release, add a section for the new version following the Keep a Changelog format. Summarize significant user-facing changes, linking to PRs/issues where possible.
3.  **Modifying `CONTRIBUTING.md`:** If build steps ([Chapter 56](56_build_system.md)), test commands ([Chapter 57](57_testing_framework.md)), or branching strategies change, update this file accordingly. Add new tools required for development setup.
4.  **Updating Code Quality Rules (`.roo/rules/rules.md`):** Add new rules decided by the team (e.g., preferring a specific state management pattern, banning a problematic library feature). Remove obsolete rules. Ensure rules align with current linter/formatter configurations.
5.  **Updating Translation Guidelines (`.roo/rules-translate/`):** Add new terms to glossaries that require consistent translation. Clarify instructions based on translator feedback. Update the QA process or validation script usage if needed.
6.  **Updating `PRIVACY.md`:** If the `TelemetryService` ([Chapter 52: TelemetryService](52_telemetryservice.md)) changes the *type* of anonymous data collected (while still avoiding PII), update the privacy policy to reflect this transparently.

**Best Practices:**

*   **Keep Updated:** Regularly review and update all documentation, especially `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md`. Outdated information is worse than none.
*   **Clarity & Conciseness:** Write for the intended audience. Use clear headings, lists, code blocks, and links. Be concise.
*   **Standard Formats:** Follow community standards (Keep a Changelog, Contributor Covenant). Use standard GitHub file locations.
*   **Automation:** Use CI ([Chapter 57](57_testing_framework.md)) to enforce code standards mentioned in `rules.md`. Use GitHub templates (`.github/`) to standardize contributions. Automate documentation updates (like contributors list) where possible.
*   **Discoverability:** Link related documents together logically (e.g., README -> CONTRIBUTING -> Architecture Docs -> Rules).
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure all technical instructions (setup, build, test commands) are accurate and have been tested. Ensure policy documents (LICENSE, PRIVACY, SECURITY) are accurate and legally sound.

**Potential Pitfalls:**

*   **Outdated Documentation:** The most common and detrimental issue.
*   **Inaccurate Instructions:** Leading users/contributors down wrong paths.
*   **Missing Files:** Especially LICENSE (legal risk) or CHANGELOG (user frustration).
*   **Broken Links:** Frustrating for users navigating documentation. Link checkers can help.
*   **Unclear Contribution Process:** Discourages community involvement.
*   **Inconsistent Rules:** Conflicts between documents or between docs and reality.
*   **Guidelines Ignored:** Documentation exists but isn't followed or enforced during code review.

## Conclusion

Documentation and Community Files form the essential human interface for the Roo-Code project. They provide the necessary guidance for users to install and leverage the extension effectively, and for contributors to understand the architecture, follow project standards, and participate constructively. Files like `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE`, `PRIVACY.md`, detailed `docs/`, specific rule sets in `.roo/`, and automation via `.github/` are all crucial components. Maintaining these resources with accuracy, clarity, and consistency is vital for fostering a successful open-source project, ensuring user satisfaction, encouraging contributions, and meeting platform requirements. They are the non-code foundation upon which the project's usability and community thrive.

This chapter concludes the Roo-Code tutorial series, providing a comprehensive overview of its architecture, components, utilities, build systems, testing strategies, and supporting documentation.

# Chapter 59: Cache Strategy (Bedrock)

This chapter number duplicates the content intended for [Chapter 28: Bedrock Cache Strategy](28_bedrock_cache_strategy.md). There appears to be a mix-up in the chapter list provided.

To avoid redundancy, please refer to **[Chapter 28: Bedrock Cache Strategy](28_bedrock_cache_strategy.md)** for the detailed explanation of how Roo-Code implements strategies to leverage AWS Bedrock's prompt caching feature.

**Chapter 28 covers:**
*   The motivation for using Bedrock Prompt Caching (reducing latency and cost).
*   Key concepts like cache points (`<cache_point/>`), relevant `ModelInfo` properties (`supportsPromptCache`, `maxCachePoints`, etc.), the `BaseStrategy` interface, and the `MultiPointStrategy` implementation.
*   How the strategy determines cache point placement, including handling previous placements (N-1 rule).
*   How `AwsBedrockHandler` integrates the strategy.
*   Code walkthroughs and sequence diagrams illustrating the process.
*   Guidance on modifying or extending the caching strategies.

All information regarding Bedrock caching strategies can be found in **[Chapter 28: Bedrock Cache Strategy](28_bedrock_cache_strategy.md)**.
