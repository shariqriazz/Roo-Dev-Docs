# Chapter 57: Testing Framework

Continuing from [Chapter 56: Build System](56_build_system.md), which focused on compiling and packaging Roo-Code, this chapter delves into the strategies and tools used to ensure the quality, correctness, and stability of the codebase: the **Testing Framework**.

## Motivation: Ensuring Quality and Preventing Regressions

As Roo-Code grows in complexity, with interactions between the extension host, WebView UI, LLM APIs, file system, terminal ([Chapter 15: Terminal Integration](15_terminal_integration.md)), MCP servers ([Chapter 19: McpHub / McpServerManager](19_mcphub___mcpservermanager.md)), and various utilities ([Chapter 42](42_file_system_utilities.md)-[Chapter 45](45_text_normalization_utilities.md)), the risk of introducing bugs or regressions increases significantly. Manually testing every feature, configuration permutation, and edge case after each change is impractical, time-consuming, and unreliable.

A robust testing framework provides an automated safety net to:

1.  **Verify Correctness:** Ensure individual functions (units), components, and integrated parts behave as expected according to their specifications.
2.  **Prevent Regressions:** Automatically detect when changes inadvertently break existing functionality, providing rapid feedback to developers.
3.  **Improve Design:** The process of writing testable code often encourages better software design practices, such as modularity, clear interfaces, dependency injection, and pure functions.
4.  **Facilitate Refactoring:** Provide developers with the confidence to refactor or improve code, knowing that the test suite will likely catch any introduced errors.
5.  **Document Behavior:** Well-written tests serve as executable documentation, illustrating how components are intended to be used and what their expected outputs or side effects are under various conditions.

Roo-Code employs a multi-layered testing approach:

*   **Unit Tests:** Using **Jest** as the test runner and framework, focusing on isolating and testing individual functions or modules in the extension host (`src/`) and WebView UI (`webview-ui/src/`).
*   **Component Tests (WebView UI):** Using **Jest** with **React Testing Library** to test React components (`webview-ui/src/components/`) in a simulated browser environment (JSDOM), focusing on behavior from a user's perspective.
*   **Integration Tests (VS Code E2E):** Using **`@vscode/test-electron`** and Mocha to run tests within an actual instance of VS Code with the Roo-Code extension loaded. This verifies the integration between different parts of the extension and its interaction with the VS Code API in a realistic environment.

**Central Use Case:** A developer refactors the `ApiHandler` logic for Bedrock ([Chapter 5: ApiHandler](05_apihandler.md), [Chapter 27: Bedrock Model Identification](27_bedrock_model_identification.md)). They need confidence that the changes work correctly and haven't broken other providers or core logic.

1.  **Unit Tests:** They run Jest tests specifically targeting `AwsBedrockHandler.ts` (`pnpm test src/api/providers/bedrock.test.ts`). These tests use mocked AWS SDK clients (`jest.mock('@aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime')`) to verify that the handler correctly parses ARNs, selects model IDs, constructs API payloads, and handles responses without making actual network calls.
2.  **Component Tests:** They run Jest tests for the Settings UI (`pnpm test:ui`) to ensure changes haven't broken the display or validation related to Bedrock configuration options in `ApiOptions.tsx` ([Chapter 35: Settings UI Components (WebView)](35_settings_ui_components__webview_.md)). These tests use mocks for `postMessage` and the UI toolkit.
3.  **Integration Tests:** They run the end-to-end integration tests (`pnpm test:integration`) defined in the `e2e/` directory. One test might specifically configure Bedrock (using environment variables for credentials in the test environment), send a simple prompt via the extension's API, and assert that a valid response is received and displayed, verifying the connection and basic flow within a real VS Code instance.
4.  **Results:** If all tests pass, the developer has higher confidence that the refactoring was successful and didn't introduce regressions in Bedrock handling or unrelated areas.

## Key Concepts

1.  **Jest:** The primary JavaScript/TypeScript testing framework used for unit and component tests. ([https://jestjs.io/](https://jestjs.io/))
    *   **Test Runner:** Discovers (`*.(test|spec).ts(x)`) and executes tests.
    *   **Assertion Library:** `expect()` with matchers (`.toBe`, `.toEqual`, `.toHaveBeenCalledWith`, etc.).
    *   **Mocking:** Powerful built-in mocking (`jest.fn`, `jest.mock`, `jest.spyOn`). Essential for isolating units.
    *   **Configuration (`jest.config.js`):** Defines environments, module resolution, coverage, setup, and **projects** for managing separate host/UI test configurations.

2.  **React Testing Library (RTL):** For testing WebView UI React components ([Chapter 32](32_vscode_webview_ui_toolkit_wrappers.md)-[Chapter 39](39_human_relay_ui.md)). ([https://testing-library.com/](https://testing-library.com/))
    *   **User-Centric:** Focuses on testing component behavior as perceived by users.
    *   **`render`, `screen`, `fireEvent`/`userEvent`:** Core utilities for rendering, querying the DOM via accessible roles/text, and simulating user interactions.
    *   **`@testing-library/jest-dom`:** Adds helpful DOM-specific Jest matchers.

3.  **Testing Environments (`jest.config.js` `projects`):**
    *   **Extension Host (`displayName: "Host"`, `testEnvironment: 'node'`):** Runs `src/**/*.test.ts`. Mocks `vscode` API via `src/__mocks__/vscode.js`.
    *   **WebView UI (`displayName: "WebView"`, `testEnvironment: 'jsdom'`):** Runs `webview-ui/src/**/*.test.{ts,tsx}`. Simulates browser DOM. Mocks VS Code toolkit (`src/__mocks__/@vscode/webview-ui-toolkit/react.ts`) and `postMessage` (`@/utils/vscode`).

4.  **Mocking Dependencies:**
    *   **`vscode` API:** `src/__mocks__/vscode.js` provides `jest.fn()` implementations for essential APIs used by the host code.
    *   **VS Code Toolkit:** `src/__mocks__/@vscode/webview-ui-toolkit/react.ts` provides simple HTML equivalents for UI tests in JSDOM.
    *   **`postMessage`:** `webview-ui/src/utils/vscode.ts` is mocked in UI tests to spy on messages sent to the host.
    *   **Network/External Calls:** Modules making network requests (`ApiHandler`, `axios`, SDK clients) are mocked using `jest.mock()` to prevent real calls and control responses.
    *   **File System:** `fs/promises` is mocked (`jest.mock('fs/promises')`) for tests involving file persistence or configuration loading, allowing in-memory simulation.

5.  **Integration Testing (`e2e/`, `@vscode/test-electron`):**
    *   **Purpose:** Validates the extension within a realistic VS Code environment. Tests end-to-end flows involving UI interaction, host logic, and VS Code API usage.
    *   **Runner (`e2e/src/runTest.ts`):** Uses `@vscode/test-electron`'s `runTests` function to download a specified version of VS Code, launch it with the Roo-Code extension enabled (`--extensionDevelopmentPath`), and run a test script (`--extensionTestsPath`).
    *   **Test Suite (`e2e/src/suite/index.ts`):** The entry point for tests run inside the VS Code instance. Uses **Mocha** (common for VS Code integration tests) as the test framework (`suite`, `test`).
    *   **Setup (`suite/index.ts`):** Performs setup before running tests: activates the Roo-Code extension, gets its exported API (`globalThis.api`), configures necessary settings (like API keys sourced from `.env.local` via `process.env`), potentially focuses the WebView.
    *   **Test Files (`e2e/src/suite/*.test.ts`):** Contain Mocha tests (`suite`, `test`) that use the globally available `api` object (exported by the extension) to interact with Roo-Code (e.g., `api.startNewTask`, `api.getConfiguration`) and standard `vscode` APIs to interact with the editor or check state. Assertions use Node's built-in `assert` module.
    *   **Configuration:** Requires environment variables (e.g., `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env.local`) for API interactions during tests.

## Executing Tests

Managed via `package.json` scripts:

```json
// --- File: package.json (Excerpt) ---
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest", // Runs Host + WebView unit/component tests
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
    "test:host": "jest --selectProjects Host",
    "test:ui": "jest --selectProjects WebView",
    "test:integration": "pnpm --filter webview-ui build && node ./e2e/src/runTest.js" // Build UI, then run e2e tests
  }
}
```

*   `pnpm test:*`: Run Jest unit/component tests.
*   `pnpm test:integration`: Builds the WebView UI (needed by the extension) and then runs the end-to-end tests using `@vscode/test-electron`. Requires API keys in `.env.local`.

## Code Walkthrough

### Jest Configuration (`jest.config.js`)

*(See full code in Chapter 57 - Key Concepts)*
*   Defines "Host" (Node) and "WebView" (JSDOM) projects with separate environments, mocks paths (`roots`), and test file patterns. Configures `ts-jest` and `moduleNameMapper`.

### Mocking (`src/__mocks__/`)

*   **`vscode.js`:** Provides `jest.fn()` mocks for VS Code APIs. Tests can interact with these mocks.
*   **`@vscode/webview-ui-toolkit/react.ts`:** Provides simple React components replacing toolkit components for JSDOM tests.

### Unit/Component Tests (`*.test.ts(x)`)

*(See examples in Chapter 57 - Key Concepts)*
*   Use Jest (`describe`, `it`, `expect`).
*   Use React Testing Library for UI components (`render`, `screen`, `fireEvent`).
*   Rely on Jest's automatic or explicit mocking (`jest.mock`).

### E2E Test Runner (`e2e/src/runTest.ts`)

*(See code provided in problem description)*
*   Imports `runTests` from `@vscode/test-electron`.
*   Sets `extensionDevelopmentPath` to the project root.
*   Sets `extensionTestsPath` to the compiled E2E suite entry point (`dist/e2e/suite/index.js` - assuming JS output after build).
*   Calls `runTests`. Handles errors.

### E2E Test Suite (`e2e/src/suite/index.ts`)

*(See code provided in problem description)*
*   **Mocha Framework:** Uses Mocha's `suite` and `test` structure (common for VS Code integration tests).
*   **Initialization (`run` function):**
    *   Gets the Roo-Code extension instance using `vscode.extensions.getExtension`.
    *   Activates the extension (`extension.activate()`) to get its exported API.
    *   **Crucially configures the API** using `api.setConfiguration` with keys from `process.env` (sourced from `.env.local` by the test runner environment). This sets up the extension to use a specific provider (e.g., OpenRouter) during the tests.
    *   Focuses the Roo-Code sidebar using `executeCommand`.
    *   Waits for the API to be ready (`api.isReady()`).
    *   Exposes the `api` globally (`globalThis.api`) for use in individual test files.
    *   Uses `glob` to find compiled test files (`*.test.js`) and adds them to the Mocha runner.
    *   Runs Mocha and resolves/rejects based on failures.

### E2E Test Example (`e2e/src/suite/modes.test.ts` - Conceptual)

```typescript
// --- File: e2e/src/suite/modes.test.ts --- (Conceptual)
import * as assert from "assert";
import * as vscode from "vscode";
import { waitFor, /* other test utils */ } from "./utils"; // Import test utilities
import type { RooCodeAPI } from "../../../src/exports/roo-code"; // Import API type

// Access the globally exposed API
declare const api: RooCodeAPI;

suite("E2E Mode Switching Suite", () => {
	setup(async () => {
        // Reset to a known state before each test
        await api.clearTask(); // Clear any existing chat
		await api.setConfiguration({ mode: "ask", alwaysAllowModeSwitch: true }); // Start in 'ask' mode
        await waitFor(() => api.getCurrentMode() === "ask");
	});

	test("Should switch mode using API", async function () {
        this.timeout(20000); // Increase timeout if needed

        await api.setConfiguration({ mode: "code" });

        // Wait for mode change to be reflected (might involve checking internal state or UI)
        await waitFor(() => api.getCurrentMode() === "code", 10000, 500);

        const currentMode = api.getCurrentMode(); // Get state via API
        assert.strictEqual(currentMode, "code", `Mode should be 'code' but was '${currentMode}'`);
	});

    test("Should switch mode via chat command", async function() {
        this.timeout(60000); // Longer timeout for task execution

        // Start a task that includes a mode switch command
        const { taskId } = await api.startNewTask({ text: "/mode code" });

        // Wait for the task to indicate completion or mode switch confirmation
        let finalMode : string | undefined;
        await waitFor(async () => {
            const taskState = await api.getTaskState(taskId); // Assuming API provides task state
            finalMode = taskState?.config?.mode;
            // Check if mode switched OR task completed (might switch then complete)
            return finalMode === "code" || taskState?.status === 'completed';
        }, 50000, 1000);

        // Assert final mode state
        assert.strictEqual(api.getCurrentMode(), "code", `Mode should have switched to 'code'`);
    });

	// Add more tests for different modes, interactions, etc.
});
```

**Explanation:**

*   Uses Mocha's `suite` and `test`.
*   Uses `setup` hook to reset state before each test via the `api` object.
*   Uses `assert` for assertions.
*   Interacts with the extension via the exported `api` object (`api.setConfiguration`, `api.getCurrentMode`, `api.startNewTask`).
*   Uses a `waitFor` utility (polling) to wait for asynchronous state changes within the extension.
*   Sets longer timeouts (`this.timeout(...)`) for tests involving LLM calls or complex interactions.

## Internal Implementation

1.  **Jest (Unit/Component):** Runs tests in Node.js or JSDOM. Loads source code. Intercepts imports using `__mocks__` or `jest.mock`. Executes tests, compares results using `expect`.
2.  **VS Code Integration (`@vscode/test-electron`):**
    *   `runTests` downloads/caches a specific VS Code version.
    *   Launches VS Code with specific arguments:
        *   `--extensionDevelopmentPath=<path/to/roo-code>`: Loads Roo-Code as an installed extension.
        *   `--extensionTestsPath=<path/to/e2e/suite/index.js>`: Tells VS Code to run this script using its built-in Mocha test runner.
        *   Potentially opens a specific workspace (`--folder-uri ...`) if needed by tests.
    *   The `suite/index.ts` script runs *inside* the launched VS Code instance. It activates Roo-Code, sets up configuration (using real or test API keys from env vars), and runs the Mocha tests (`*.test.js`).
    *   Tests interact with the *actual* running extension via its exported API (`globalThis.api`) and standard `vscode` APIs.
    *   Results are reported back to the initial `runTests` process.

## Modification Guidance

Involves adding tests, updating tests, or improving mocks/setup.

1.  **Adding Unit/Component Tests:** Create `*.test.ts(x)`. Import code. Mock dependencies. Use `describe`/`it`, `expect`, RTL utils. Run with `pnpm test:host` or `pnpm test:ui`.
2.  **Adding Integration (E2E) Tests:**
    *   Create `e2e/src/suite/new_feature.test.ts`.
    *   Use Mocha's `suite`/`test` structure.
    *   Access the extension via `globalThis.api`.
    *   Use `vscode` APIs to simulate user actions or check editor state if needed.
    *   Use `assert` for checks. Use `waitFor` for async operations. Set appropriate timeouts.
    *   Ensure any required setup (e.g., specific workspace files, settings, API keys in `.env.local`) is handled in `suite/index.ts` or test setup hooks.
    *   Run with `pnpm test:integration`.
3.  **Updating Mocks:** Add/refine mocks in `src/__mocks__/` or using `jest.mock()` as needed when code dependencies change or new APIs are used.
4.  **Improving E2E Setup (`suite/index.ts`):** Add more robust setup logic, parameterize API keys/endpoints better, implement cleaner state reset between tests.

**Best Practices:**

*   **Test Pyramid:** Have many fast unit tests, fewer component tests, and even fewer slower integration (E2E) tests focusing on critical paths.
*   **Unit Test Isolation:** Mock dependencies thoroughly for unit tests.
*   **UI Test Behavior:** Use RTL's user-centric approach.
*   **E2E Critical Paths:** Use integration tests for verifying core end-to-end flows (e.g., basic chat response, tool execution, activation) and interactions with the real VS Code API.
*   **Mocking Strategy:** Use `__mocks__` for global mocks (vscode, toolkit), `jest.mock` for specific module dependencies.
*   **CI Integration:** Run all relevant tests (lint, compile, unit, component, potentially integration) in the CI pipeline.
*   **Test Data:** Use realistic but non-sensitive test data.
*   **Maintainability:** Write clear, focused tests.

**Potential Pitfalls:**

*   **Incomplete/Incorrect Mocks (Unit/Component):** False confidence.
*   **Environment Mismatch (Unit/Component vs. E2E):** Tests pass but fail in real VS Code.
*   **Flaky E2E Tests:** Relying on specific timings, UI states, network latency. Use robust `waitFor` utilities. E2E tests are inherently more prone to flakiness.
*   **Slow E2E Tests:** Launching VS Code for each run is slow. Group tests logically. Run E2E less frequently than unit tests.
*   **E2E Setup Complexity:** Managing VS Code instances, workspaces, settings, and extension state for E2E tests can be complex. Requires API keys/environment setup.
*   **Testing Implementation Details:** Brittle tests breaking on refactoring.

## Conclusion

The Testing Framework for Roo-Code employs a multi-layered strategy to ensure quality and prevent regressions. **Jest** provides the foundation for fast unit tests (in Node.js for host code) and component tests (in JSDOM with **React Testing Library** for WebView UI), relying heavily on mocking external dependencies like the `vscode` API and UI toolkit. **VS Code Integration Tests** using `@vscode/test-electron` and Mocha provide crucial end-to-end validation by running tests against the actual extension within a real VS Code instance, verifying core workflows and API interactions. This combination of unit, component, and integration tests, automated via `package.json` scripts and run in CI, provides essential confidence in the extension's stability and correctness during development and refactoring.

Finally, we'll look at the documentation and community-related files that support the project: [Chapter 58: Documentation & Community Files](58_documentation___community_files.md).

# Chapter 59: Cache Strategy (Bedrock)

This chapter number duplicates the content intended for [Chapter 28: Bedrock Cache Strategy](28_bedrock_cache_strategy.md). There appears to be a mix-up in the chapter list provided.

To avoid redundancy, please refer to **[Chapter 28: Bedrock Cache Strategy](28_bedrock_cache_strategy.md)** for the detailed explanation of how Roo-Code implements strategies to leverage AWS Bedrock's prompt caching feature.

**Chapter 28 covers:**
*   The motivation for using Bedrock Prompt Caching (reducing latency and cost).
*   Key concepts like cache points (`<cache_point/>`), relevant `ModelInfo` properties (`supportsPromptCache`, `maxCachePoints`, etc.), the `BaseStrategy` interface, and the `MultiPointStrategy` implementation.
*   How the strategy determines cache point placement, including handling previous placements (N-1 rule).
*   How `AwsBedrockHandler` integrates the strategy.
*   Code walkthroughs and sequence diagrams illustrating the process.
*   Guidance on modifying or extending the caching strategies.

All information regarding Bedrock caching strategies can be found in **[Chapter 28: Bedrock Cache Strategy](28_bedrock_cache_strategy.md)**.
